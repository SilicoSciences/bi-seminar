# Applied Bioinformatics in the Shell and in the Cloud

## NGS Data Analysis Using Unix and Open Source Tools 

# Advanced

## Monitoring

`top`

`iotop`

`ps`

## Subshells

*sequential* commands (connected with `&&`) and *piped* commands (connected with `|`)
Sequential:
1. *not* connected, both print to stdout.
2. `&&` consideres exit status, `;` doesn't.

    $ echo "this command"; echo "that command" | sed 's/command/step/'
    this command
    that step

    $ (echo "this command"; echo "that command") | sed 's/command/step/'
    this step
    that step
